# RWK Canvas Timeline

This plugin creates a markdown table from a canvas and sorts it on x value and with groups.

It uses the Obsidian (https://obsidian.md) Sample Plugin as a boilerplate template, which can be found here - (https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-theme)

The text suggest code is a simplified version from obsidian-note-from-template which can be found here - (https://github.com/mo-seph/obsidian-note-from-template)

Be careful which note you select to output the table to. It may change any table you already have in the note.
